This project is a Bank Management System developed using Java and JDBC.
It is a console-based application that demonstrates how Java applications interact with a database using JDBC.
The project allows users to:
Check bank account balance
Transfer money between accounts
Validate account details
The application follows a layered architecture using Bean, DAO, Service, Utility, and Main classes.
All database operations such as fetching balance and updating transfer details are handled through JDBC.
This project is mainly developed to understand JDBC connectivity, SQL execution, and real-time banking logic in Java.
