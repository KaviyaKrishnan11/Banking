It is a console-based application that demonstrates how Java applications interact with a database using JDBC.
The project allows users to:
Check bank account balance
Transfer money between accounts
Validate account details
The application follows a layered architecture using Bean, DAO, Service, Utility, and Main classes.
All database operations such as fetching balance and updating transfer details are handled through JDBC.
